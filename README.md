# California Housing Price Predictor

A Streamlit web application that predicts the median house value in California using a Random Forest regression model trained on the California Housing dataset.

---

## Dataset

This project uses the [California Housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html) from scikit-learn, which contains data collected from the 1990 U.S. Census. The dataset includes the following features:

- **MedInc**: Median income in block group
- **HouseAge**: Median house age in block group
- **AveRooms**: Average number of rooms per household
- **AveBedrms**: Average number of bedrooms per household
- **Population**: Block group population
- **AveOccup**: Average number of household members
- **Latitude**: Block group latitude
- **Longitude**: Block group longitude

The target variable is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars.

- Display of model performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Model saved as `housing_model.pkl` for reuse or deployment
